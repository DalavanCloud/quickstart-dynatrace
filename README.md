## Dynatrace Managed Cluster on AWS

This Quick Start sets up a highly available, secure AWS environment, and automatically launches a Dynatrace Managed cluster into a new or existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Dynatrace Managed is an AI-powered automated performance management solution. You can use a single platform to analyze application performance throughout your applicationâ€™s full stack, down to each individual transaction across all layers and technologies.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with this Quick Start to deploy a Dynatrace Managed cluster in your AWS account. This Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying a Dynatrace Managed cluster into a new VPC
- Deploying a Dynatrace Managed cluster into an existing VPC 

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
